hdmi_mgb2_v11 project:  

story:   
using xilinx hdmirx1.4/2.0 subsystem ip and xilinx hdmitx1.4/2.0 ip and xilinx video phy controller and memory storge system and the others ip 
to implement a hdmi passthrough system on synopsys haps connect daughter card hdmi_mgb2_v11.  
this repos conatin a hdmi vdma+ddr4 passthrough project  

you can see Multimedia User Guide (UG1449) to look for which is suitable for you as the solution.  


all project can depart or remix into following project that is already developed and tested well: 
project and usage content:  
1 hdmi_mgb2_v11:
1. hdmi tx_only project: use tpg and xilinx hdmi1.4/2.0 tx subsystem and video phy controller for output the video stream   
2. hdmi rx_only project: use video phy controller and xilinx hdmi1.4/2.0 tx subsystem to receive input hdmi video data and convert into axi stream
   
1 hdmi_mgb2_v11 + 1 ddr4_ht3:   
4. hdmi rx+vdma+ddr4 project: add extra add extra video dma and ddr4 as the storage system on hdmi rx_only project  
5. hdmi passthrough project: combine rx and tx feature,  rx can receive the input video stream and analysis the infomation and use this infomation for tx's configuration  
6. hdmi vdma+ddr4 passthrough project : similar to hdmi passthrough project, add extra video dma and ddr4 as the video buffer.   

2 hdmi_mgb2_v11 + 1 ddr4_ht3:   
7. hdmi tx_only+oversampling to hdmi rx+dru+vdma+ddr4: combine tx_only with oversampling project and rx+dru+vdma+ddr4 project and verify the lowest pixel clk is 12.375M/s  
8. hdmi rx+vdma+ddr4 to hdmi_tx_only: in order to seperate the video controller, combine tx_only project and rx+vdma+ddr4 project to verify the maximum capability.

capability:  
rx only and rx+vdma+ddr4: support up to 3840x2160@30fhz resolution's video.  
rx only+dru and and rx+vdma+ddr4+dru: support up to 3840x2160@30fhz resolution's video and low to pixel clk is 12.375M/s.  
tx only: support up to 3840x2160@60fhz resolution's video.  
tx_only+oversampling: support up to 3840x2160@60fhz resolution's video and low to 3840x2160@2fhz (support lowest pixel clk is 12.375M/s).  
passthrough project and vdma+ddr4 passthrough project: support up to 3840x2160@30fhz resolution's video and support 32 bit 2 channel with 48k sample rate for passsthrough AES3 foramt audio data.  

in HDMI1.4: maximum support pixel clk is 340MHz  
the maximum bandwidth: 340MHz*10bitï¼ˆ10bit encodeï¼‰*3ï¼ˆ3 data lanesï¼‰= 10.2Gbps  
according HDMI is using 8b/10bï¼Œit need to discont 20% of original bandwidthï¼Œhence 10.2Gbps can support maximum bandwidth is: 10.2*0.8= 8.1Gbps  

under HDMI1.4, 3840x2160@60fps yuv420 can be supported because the bandwidth: 4400*2250*8bit*60fps=4.752Gbps can meet the requirement.  

in HDMI2.0: maximum support pixel clk is 600MHz  
the maximum bandwidth: 600MHz*10bitï¼ˆ10bit encodeï¼‰*3ï¼ˆ3 data lanesï¼‰= 18Gbps   
according HDMI is using 8b/10bï¼Œit need to discont 20% of original bandwidthï¼Œhence 18Gbps can support maximum bandwidth is: 18*0.8= 14.4Gbps  


if you need to receive a video stream with 3840x2160@60fps, bpc=8, format is rgb888 =>  
required bandwidth: 4400*2250*24bit*60fps=14.256Gbps  
hence only HDMI2.0 or higher can support the bandwidth

to be updated and check:
rx replicate hpd issue in 3840x2160@60fps will happen at:  
video format rgb888  
video format yuv422

but not happen at 3840x2160@60fps in yuv420:

assume is cause by not support custom mode, => checked, video mode is independent to video format,  
yuv420:  
it means that rx receive 
1. need to check rx's highest supported pixel clk.
2. need to check what cause rx issue replicate hpd signal.
3. check if support hdmi2.0 in edid, because 1.4 is not support 3840x2160@60fhz due to its bandwidth limit.
4. dynmaic_config_VDMA(): if rx receive video infomation doesn't exist at video_timing_table, need to add it maunally(try to add 3840x2160@60fhz cvt and 3840x2160@60fhz cvtrb)
5. add DRU feature and oversampling feature at 1 hdmi_mgb2_v11 + 1 ddr4_ht3:
